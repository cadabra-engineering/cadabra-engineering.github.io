# ⚙️ Cadabra Engineering Notes

Technical patterns, practical insights, and AI-native approaches — from research to runtime.


👋 Welcome

This is our public knowledge space where we share reusable engineering concepts, AI-powered workflows, and lessons from the field.
Most of what’s here is extracted from our real implementation work — refined across client projects, internal tools, and continuous experiments.

We publish what we would want to find ourselves: concise, context-rich, and ready to apply. We believe we can reframe software delivery from the ground up, where every decision, tool, and interaction is guided by contextual intelligence. 


📐 What’s Inside
    •    🧠 AI Engineering Patterns
LangChain orchestration, vector database setups, embedding workflows, LLM chaining strategies
    •    🛠️ DevOps & MLOps Templates
CI/CD pipelines for models and APIs, retraining logic, rollback mechanisms, hybrid infrastructure guides
    •    🧩 Architecture Notes
Modular system diagrams, API-first layouts, event-driven design using AI decision nodes
    •    🎯 Prompt Engineering & Evaluation
Structured prompt templates, scoring methods, context optimization techniques
    •    🧪 Experiments & Benchmarks
Real data on latency, accuracy, prompt cost optimization, multi-agent flows under load


🧭 How We Use This

Every entry in this space is:
    •    🔍 Sourced from our Medium, LinkedIn, and Reddit posts
    •    🧱 Based on real components, systems, or workflows we’ve shipped
    •    🧾 Reviewed for reusability — no fluff, just practical tech


🗂️ How You Can Use It
    •    Reference system design ideas
    •    Reuse prompt logic or evaluation strategies
    •    Build on our API deployment patterns
    •    Copy/paste code snippets into your own infra
    •    Stay aligned with how modern AI delivery is evolving
