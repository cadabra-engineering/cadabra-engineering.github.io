## Applied Intelligence in Practice: Engineering Notes by Cadabra

Technical patterns, practical insights, and AI-native approaches — from research to runtime.

---

## 👋 Welcome

This is our public knowledge space where we share reusable engineering concepts, AI-powered workflows, and lessons from the field.
Most of what’s here is extracted from our real implementation work — refined across client projects, internal tools, and continuous experiments.

We publish what we would want to find ourselves: concise, context-rich, and ready to apply.  
We believe we can reframe software delivery from the ground up, where every decision, tool, and interaction is guided by contextual intelligence.
