    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) swiftly is crucial for validating new ideas and attracting early investment. The challenge arises from the need to balance speed with maintaining a robust architecture, all while handling integration complexities and ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>We believe we can reframe software delivery from the ground up, where every decision, tool, and interaction is guided by contextual intelligence.</em> ‚Äî Cadabra Studio</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-we-tried-and-why">What We Tried (and Why)</h2>

<p>Given the tight timeline for creating a cross-platform assistant tool, we opted for a methodology called vibe-coding. This approach blends AI-assisted coding with a prompt-driven architecture, enabling rapid iterations and focus on high-level design over manual code writing. Initial efforts involved deploying a lightweight Flutter app integrated with Firebase and OpenAI‚Äôs API for speech and text transformation tasks.</p>

<h2 id="what-broke-or-didnt-work">What Broke or Didn‚Äôt Work</h2>

<p>The primary challenge lay in AI‚Äôs occasional ‚Äúhallucinations,‚Äù where it incorrectly guessed solutions, as well as the variability in AI-generated code quality. Many features required multiple prompt iterations before achieving desired outcomes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>üìå <em>Takeaway: Always maintain manual oversight and verify AI-generated code.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-shift-we-made">The Shift We Made</h2>

<p>To counteract AI‚Äôs limitations, we introduced stringent review processes, combined AI-generated outputs with traditional testing, and centralized architectural oversight to preserve system coherence.</p>

<h2 id="what-worked-and-what-still-doesnt">What Worked (and What Still Doesn‚Äôt)</h2>

<p>The vibe-coding approach enabled us to complete the MVP 60% faster than traditional methodologies without compromising core functionalities. However, it‚Äôs evident that AI-driven development requires human expertise for complex tasks like real-time operations and advanced concurrency management.</p>

<h2 id="open-questions-were-still-exploring">Open Questions We‚Äôre Still Exploring</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How can AI improve real-time code optimization?</li>
  <li>What‚Äôs the most effective balance between AI prompts and manual input?</li>
  <li>How do we maintain code quality in the long term with AI-first approaches?</li>
