    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In recent years, the rush to integrate AI into workflows has often resulted in minimal ROI. Many companies find themselves adding complexity in pursuit of efficiency. The core challenge we faced was integrating AI into our development processes without compromising our team dynamics, creativity, or project coherence.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-tried-and-why">What We Tried (and Why)</h2>

<p>Initially, we incorporated AI tools with the expectation of accelerating speed and improving individual productivity. The rationale was to enhance the efficiency of tasks such as layout design, research automation, and coding. However, we recognized that the real value lay not just in individual output but in the integration of these outputs into a cohesive process.</p>

<h2 id="what-broke-or-didnt-work">What Broke or Didn’t Work</h2>

<p>Our original implementation didn’t foster better collaboration. While AI facilitated faster individual output, it inadvertently increased the gap between different teams, emphasizing the difference between skilled and unskilled work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>📌 <em>Takeaway: Successful AI integration requires a focus on workflow alignment, not merely task acceleration.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-shift-we-made">The Shift We Made</h2>

<p>To address these challenges, we developed what we call a “hybrid development loop”. This is a framework that combines human ideation and AI support while maintaining creative coherence. The process ensures that AI tools enhance, rather than disrupt, our workflow. We emphasized checkpoints throughout our process that align AI outputs with our business logic, user empathy, and product vision.</p>

<h2 id="what-worked-and-what-still-doesnt">What Worked (and What Still Doesn’t)</h2>

<p>Our new approach led to tangible improvements: designers elevated to art directors faster, analysts focused on strategy over decks, and developers shifted to architectural thinking. However, alignment across teams remains a challenge when disparate AI tools are involved, especially when processes accelerate in unintended directions.</p>

      <td>Simple implementation but can fragment team dynamics</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h2 id="open-questions-were-still-exploring">Open Questions We’re Still Exploring</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How do we ensure sustained alignment without stifling creativity?</li>
  <li>What are the best practices for integrating AI across varied workflows?</li>
  <li>How can we measure the qualitative improvements brought by AI?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="if-youre-solving-something-similar">If You’re Solving Something Similar…</h2>

<p>We are eager to collaborate with other teams facing similar challenges of integrating AI into development processes. Sharing insights and strategies can support mutual success in melding creativity with technological advancement.</p>
