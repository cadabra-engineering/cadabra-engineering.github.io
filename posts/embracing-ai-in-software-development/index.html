    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in software development has been at the forefront of technological discourse, with many heralding it as the future. However, the practical application has revealed that 95% of companies have not achieved measurable ROI from their AI initiatives. This disconnect highlights the challenge of effectively incorporating AI while balancing speed with quality and maintaining the essential human elements of creativity and insight.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-tried-and-why">What We Tried (and Why)</h2>

<p>At Cadabra Studio, we aimed to incorporate AI tools into our product-development pipeline to enhance efficiency without compromising quality. We experimented with various AI coding assistants for routine tasks, AI design/prototyping platforms for wireframes and UI concepts, and AI tools for copy and documentation. The goal was to leverage AI to accelerate our workflows while keeping human creativity and judgment at the core of our process.</p>

<h2 id="what-broke-or-didnt-work">What Broke or Didn’t Work</h2>

<p>While AI boosted efficiency in early project phases, particularly for prototyping and boilerplate creation, its usefulness diminished in complex areas involving business logic and nuanced user experience design. AI’s inability to grasp business nuances and innovate on customer emotions highlighted its limitations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>📌 <em>Takeaway: AI can enhance initial productivity but requires human oversight for contextual accuracy and innovation.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-shift-we-made">The Shift We Made</h2>

<p>To address these shortcomings, we adopted a hybrid model where AI automates repetitive, high-volume tasks, allowing human teams to focus on judgment, context, creativity, and strategy. This model involves an iterative pipeline: AI draft → human review → production, ensuring human validation and oversight at every stage of the development process.</p>

<h2 id="what-worked-and-what-still-doesnt">What Worked (and What Still Doesn’t)</h2>

<p>This revised approach resulted in a 20–30% reduction in turnaround times during initial phases, facilitating faster project initiation and unblocking teams more swiftly. However, the challenge of aligning AI outputs with real user needs and business logic persists, as efficiency gains often translate into extensive review work rather than eliminating effort altogether.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do we effectively measure AI’s value in our business beyond speed and cost-savings?</li>
  <li>What advancements can be made to integrate AI outputs with domain-specific logic seamlessly?</li>
  <li>How can we further optimize AI-human collaboration in product development?</li>
</ul>
