    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The core challenge revolved around the implementation of an app that was originally built with a ‚Äúquick and dirty‚Äù approach, heavily reliant on momentum rather than stability. The primary problem wasn‚Äôt just the technical issues at hand; it was the misalignment between the app and the client‚Äôs business objectives. Without clearly defining the business function of the app, bug fixes would be superficial remedies rather than sustainable solutions.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-tried-and-why">What We Tried (and Why)</h2>

<p>Initially, the approach might have been to dive straight into the codebase to fix the apparent bugs. However, we realized that without understanding the app‚Äôs intended role within the client‚Äôs business, technical fixes would not address the underlying vulnerabilities. Therefore, we conducted an audit of the client‚Äôs business goals and user requirements before proceeding. This allowed us to adjust the app‚Äôs user experience (UX) to better align with those insights, ensuring our development work was focused on accurately fulfilling the business‚Äôs needs.</p>

<h2 id="what-broke-or-didnt-work">What Broke or Didn‚Äôt Work</h2>

<p>The original app‚Äôs failure was not purely technical but also strategic. It was designed without a concrete connection to the client‚Äôs operational needs, causing core functionalities to break down under real-world usage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>üìå <em>Takeaway: Prioritize understanding business needs over rapid completion in order to prevent future shortcomings.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-shift-we-made">The Shift We Made</h2>

<p>We shifted our strategy by first defining the client‚Äôs objectives clearly, mapping those to the user experience, and then restructuring the app‚Äôs architecture. Our development efforts were rooted in delivering business value, which meant each coding decision was closely aligned with these goals.</p>

<h2 id="what-worked-and-what-still-doesnt">What Worked (and What Still Doesn‚Äôt)</h2>

<p>By realigning development priorities with the business objectives, the app not only became functional but also operationally supportive of core workflows. This alignment was pivotal in enabling users to accomplish tasks effectively. However, the need for continuous UX and feature optimization remains an ongoing pursuit to cater to evolving user expectations and business dynamics.</p>
