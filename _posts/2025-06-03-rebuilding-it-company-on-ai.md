## Background

Cadabra Studio, a long-standing IT company in healthcare and insurance, faced a pivotal challenge: transforming from a traditional outsourcing partner into an AI-native company. This transition required embedding AI into every layer of their software development lifecycle (SDLC), driven by client demand for deeper AI integration.

## What We Tried (and Why)

Cadabra Studio began by mapping their entire SDLC to identify where AI could enhance processes. The main challenge was not a lack of available tools but rather selecting the right ones from an overwhelming number of options. Therefore, the team created an AI selection matrix and tested tools in small pods to determine their effectiveness before wider adoption.

## What Broke or Didn’t Work

Initial skepticism and psychological barriers among team members were significant hurdles. Despite selecting effective tools, fears of replacement and distrust in AI outputs slowed the adoption process. The realization was that it was less an issue of implementation and more about cultural transformation.

> 📌 **Takeaway**: Transformation is as much about cultural change as it is about technological implementation.

## The Shift We Made

Cadabra Studio launched an internal AI adoption course including live coaching, emotional resistance sessions, team workshops, and integration planning. This effort was aimed at rebuilding trust in AI, the leadership, and the company's direction.

## What Worked (and What Still Doesn’t)

The transformation led to significant timeline reductions: MVP timelines shrank by 45–80% and pre-development cycles by 38%. Internal satisfaction increased, reflecting the team's engagement in meaningful work. AI became an integral part of the team rather than a mere tool. However, ongoing challenges include when to trust AI outputs and balancing between automation and human judgment.

## Tradeoffs and Strategic Decisions

| Option A                                             | Option B                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Focused on foundational AI integration across SDLC   | Limited AI to specific project applications  |
| Long-term cultural and operational overhaul          | Short-term, feature-focused implementation   |

## Open Questions We’re Still Exploring

- How do we determine when AI outputs are trustworthy?
- What is the best approach to version agent behavior?
- How do we define boundaries between smart automation and human oversight?
