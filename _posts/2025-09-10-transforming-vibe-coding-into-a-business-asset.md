## Background

The core challenge revolved around the implementation of an app that was originally built with a "quick and dirty" approach, heavily reliant on momentum rather than stability. The primary problem wasn't just the technical issues at hand; it was the misalignment between the app and the client's business objectives. Without clearly defining the business function of the app, bug fixes would be superficial remedies rather than sustainable solutions.

## What We Tried (and Why)

Initially, the approach might have been to dive straight into the codebase to fix the apparent bugs. However, we realized that without understanding the app's intended role within the client's business, technical fixes would not address the underlying vulnerabilities. Therefore, we conducted an audit of the client's business goals and user requirements before proceeding. This allowed us to adjust the app's user experience (UX) to better align with those insights, ensuring our development work was focused on accurately fulfilling the business's needs.

## What Broke or Didnâ€™t Work

The original app's failure was not purely technical but also strategic. It was designed without a concrete connection to the clientâ€™s operational needs, causing core functionalities to break down under real-world usage.

> ðŸ“Œ *Takeaway: Prioritize understanding business needs over rapid completion in order to prevent future shortcomings.*

## The Shift We Made

We shifted our strategy by first defining the client's objectives clearly, mapping those to the user experience, and then restructuring the appâ€™s architecture. Our development efforts were rooted in delivering business value, which meant each coding decision was closely aligned with these goals.

## What Worked (and What Still Doesnâ€™t)

By realigning development priorities with the business objectives, the app not only became functional but also operationally supportive of core workflows. This alignment was pivotal in enabling users to accomplish tasks effectively. However, the need for continuous UX and feature optimization remains an ongoing pursuit to cater to evolving user expectations and business dynamics.

## Tradeoffs and Strategic Decisions

| Define Business Needs First | Fix Bugs Immediately |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Improved alignment with business goals; reduced long-term rework | Fast initial delivery; potentially superficial fixes |
| Time investment in the short term for strategic planning | Risk of superficial, temporary solutions |

## Open Questions Weâ€™re Still Exploring

- How can we optimize UX design to better anticipate future business requirements?
- What are the best practices for integrating AI-driven tools in alignment with strategic business objectives?
- How do we continuously evaluate and adapt the architectural design to support scalability and flexibility?

## If You're Solving Something Similar...

We invite engineers and researchers facing similar challenges in aligning technical implementations with business strategy to collaborate or share insights. Understanding the delicate balance between speed and strategic alignment can significantly impact project success.
