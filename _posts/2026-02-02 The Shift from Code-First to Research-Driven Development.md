## Background

The traditional software lifecycle often treated the "Research" phase as non-essential, mainly focusing on requirements gathering before jumping into coding. However, the rise of generative AI has upended this model. Code generation now outpaces the need for manual writing, shifting the bottleneck from production speed to strategic direction. This evolution highlights the need for Research-Driven Development (RDD), where the focus shifts from rapid shipping to discerning what is worth building.

## What We Tried (and Why)

Initially, software development prioritized speed, leading to the rapid adoption of frameworks and tools with minimal initial research. This method aimed to capitalize on development velocity to deliver products quickly, benefiting from short development cycles.

## What Broke or Didn’t Work

The reliance on AI-generated code introduced systemic vulnerabilities and a lack of intentionality in design, often resulting in fragility at scaling. This oversight stemmed from treating code as an asset without thoroughly analyzing long-term implications and technical debt.

> 📌 *Intentionality in development must precede rapid code generation to avoid future technical liabilities.*

## The Shift We Made

The shift involved adopting Research-Driven Development, emphasizing deep architectural analysis, preservation of context and intent, and predictive simulation of feature lifecycle. This approach aims to understand the business logic thoroughly before coding, preserving intellectual property integrity and predicting potential issues before deployment.

## What Worked (and What Still Doesn’t)

Adopting RDD principles improved clarity over the engineering process and asset value preservation. It allowed for identifying technical debts early, thus reducing long-term liabilities. However, challenges remain in fully integrating these practices within teams heavily invested in speed-oriented methodologies.

## Tradeoffs and Strategic Decisions

| Option A (RDD)                                            | Option B (Traditional Agile)                              |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Extensive upfront research ensures directed growth        | Rapid development cycles can lead to faster time-to-market |
| Improved long-term asset value and reduced technical debt | Potentially higher technical debt due to speed priorities  |

## Open Questions We’re Still Exploring

- How can RDD be effectively integrated with existing agile practices without hindering speed?
- What tools can assist in documenting architectural intent effectively?
- How can we maintain balance between innovation and rigorous research?
