## Background

Developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) swiftly is crucial for validating new ideas and attracting early investment. The challenge arises from the need to balance speed with maintaining a robust architecture, all while handling integration complexities and ensuring a seamless user experience.

> *We believe we can reframe software delivery from the ground up, where every decision, tool, and interaction is guided by contextual intelligence.* â€” Cadabra Studio

## What We Tried (and Why)

Given the tight timeline for creating a cross-platform assistant tool, we opted for a methodology called vibe-coding. This approach blends AI-assisted coding with a prompt-driven architecture, enabling rapid iterations and focus on high-level design over manual code writing. Initial efforts involved deploying a lightweight Flutter app integrated with Firebase and OpenAI's API for speech and text transformation tasks.

## What Broke or Didnâ€™t Work

The primary challenge lay in AI's occasional "hallucinations," where it incorrectly guessed solutions, as well as the variability in AI-generated code quality. Many features required multiple prompt iterations before achieving desired outcomes.

> ðŸ“Œ *Takeaway: Always maintain manual oversight and verify AI-generated code.*

## The Shift We Made

To counteract AI's limitations, we introduced stringent review processes, combined AI-generated outputs with traditional testing, and centralized architectural oversight to preserve system coherence.

## What Worked (and What Still Doesnâ€™t)

The vibe-coding approach enabled us to complete the MVP 60% faster than traditional methodologies without compromising core functionalities. However, it's evident that AI-driven development requires human expertise for complex tasks like real-time operations and advanced concurrency management.

## Tradeoffs and Strategic Decisions

| Option A (Vibe-Coding)       | Option B (Traditional Development) |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Faster development with AI assistance | Established methodologies with predictable outcomes |
| Risk of AI misinterpretation; requires oversight | More manual, potentially slower, but consistent quality |
| Smaller team, reduced costs | Larger team for extensive manual coding |

## Open Questions Weâ€™re Still Exploring

- How can AI improve real-time code optimization?
- What's the most effective balance between AI prompts and manual input?
- How do we maintain code quality in the long term with AI-first approaches?

## If You're Solving Something Similar...

We encourage collaboration and the sharing of methodologies for using AI in rapid product development. If you're facing similar challenges or exploring AI-augmented workflows, let's connect and build better solutions together.
