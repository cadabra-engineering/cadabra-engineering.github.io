## Background

The core challenge we faced was reducing the time lag between design approval and an operational interface. Despite advancements in AI, tools for generating code from Figma files were often hindered by files structured primarily for visual appeal rather than functional design logic.

## What We Tried (and Why)

Our initial approach involved using beautifully designed Figma files to accelerate the frontend development process. The rationale was that a visually perfect design could seamlessly translate into efficient code, thus reducing development time significantly.

## What Broke or Didn’t Work

Our plan started to falter when AI-based coding tools struggled with Figma files that lacked structured design principles. These tools were easily confused by designs without a semantic hierarchy or scalable components.

> 📌 *Takeaway: Structure in design is critical for effective AI code generation.*

## The Shift We Made

We revised our design approach, treating Figma as a system rather than just a design canvas. Key changes included implementing auto-layout, using nested containers and scalable components, and ensuring a semantic hierarchy in designs. This structural discipline enabled a more efficient Figma to frontend pipeline.

## What Worked (and What Still Doesn’t)

With our new design strategy in place, AI-generated functional UIs almost instantly, allowing developers to focus on the logic rather than basic HTML structuring. However, when working with externally provided "visually perfect" Figma files lacking this structure, development workflow was still hindered.

## Tradeoffs and Strategic Decisions

| Option A                | Option B                         |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Systematic Figma design | Visual-first approach            |
| Faster AI code generation | Potentially faster initial design time |
| More upfront design effort | Increased development technical debt |

## Open Questions We’re Still Exploring

- How to balance visual creativity with structural design discipline?
- Are there alternative toolchains to MCP + Cursor that offer similar reliability?
- How can AI tools be further refined to handle less structured design files?

## If You're Solving Something Similar...

We're eager to collaborate with others exploring AI-driven design to development pipelines. What tools or techniques have you found effective? Let's discuss potential collaboration opportunities and share insights for further improving the future of frontend development.
