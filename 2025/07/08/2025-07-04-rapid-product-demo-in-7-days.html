    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Delivering a fully operational product demo in just one week posed a significant challenge for our team. The timeframe eliminated the possibility for in-depth discussions or perfecting technology stacks. Instead, the focus was solely on creating a compelling simulation of a complete product to satisfy investor expectations.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-tried-and-why">What We Tried (and Why)</h2>

<p>Faced with extreme time constraints, we opted for a hyper-focused development approach. Key objectives were to create convincing UI/UX flows and sensations that aligned with investor priorities. The reality that investors prioritize look and feel over technical rigor during demos guided this approach.</p>

<h2 id="what-broke-or-didnt-work">What Broke or Didn‚Äôt Work</h2>

<p>Traditional development practices‚Äîemphasizing long-term codebase health, unit testing, and scalability‚Äîwere set aside. The immediate aim was an illusion of a complete product, not architectural integrity or long-term maintainability.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>üìå <em>Lesson: In investor demos, prioritize visual impact and user experience over technical sophistication.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-shift-we-made">The Shift We Made</h2>

<p>We adopted a development strategy we termed ‚ÄúVibe Coding,‚Äù focusing on fast iteration and integration of components using AI-driven tools. Development started concurrently with design, allowing us to lay groundwork such as project structures, libraries, and routing ahead of integrating the UI.</p>

<h2 id="what-worked-and-what-still-doesnt">What Worked (and What Still Doesn‚Äôt)</h2>

<p>This approach yielded a clickable demo with over 20 polished screens and smooth transitions within the 7-day window. The client advanced further with investors, but the code‚Äôs structural health was compromised; elements were deliberately mocked or hardcoded, demanding a subsequent refactoring phase for sustainability.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How can we integrate faster, iterative processes into sustainable long-term development cycles?</li>
  <li>What criteria should be used to determine when to prioritize speed over functionality?</li>
  <li>How can hybrid AI-human workflows be optimized for larger scale projects?</li>
