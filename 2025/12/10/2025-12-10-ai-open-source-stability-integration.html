    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Incorporating AI tools into our development workflow, traditionally reliant on Open Source Software (OSS), highlighted systemic challenges rather than the expected efficiency improvements. These tools inadvertently amplified existing issues such as outdated dependencies, security vulnerabilities, and reliance on abandoned projects within the OSS ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-tried-and-why">What We Tried (and Why)</h2>

<p>Initially, we leveraged AI to streamline processes, assuming it would naturally accelerate tasks and mitigate the mundane aspects of development. The integration was intended to capitalize on AI’s ability to automate and enhance performance across our OSS-based infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="what-broke-or-didnt-work">What Broke or Didn’t Work</h2>

<p>The introduction of AI uncovered critical flaws within the OSS ecosystem, including dependency on unsupported packages and unsafe coding practices. AI’s methodology of accelerating existing systems quickly magnified these vulnerabilities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>📌 <em>AI doesn’t inherently improve weak foundations; it accelerates existing structural issues.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-shift-we-made">The Shift We Made</h2>

<p>To counteract these challenges, we began using commercially supported libraries and introduced strict validation processes for AI-generated code. We incorporated Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) assessments into our Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, prioritizing enterprise-grade Security Development Kits (SDKs).</p>

<h2 id="what-worked-and-what-still-doesnt">What Worked (and What Still Doesn’t)</h2>

<p>This strategic pivot led to a 3–5× reduction in AI-recommended vulnerabilities. SBOMs allowed us to uncover previously hidden risks, enhancing code consistency and security. Nonetheless, this approach requires ongoing maintenance and incurs higher costs due to dependencies on commercial solutions.</p>

      <th>Option A</th>
      <th>Option B</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Utilize commercially supported libraries and strict validation</td>
      <td>Continue with open-source options and minimal AI intervention</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Pros: Improved security, reduced vulnerabilities, increased code stability. Cons: Higher costs</td>
      <td>Pros: Lower costs. Cons: Increased risk of vulnerabilities, reduced control over AI suggestions</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="open-questions-were-still-exploring">Open Questions We’re Still Exploring</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How can we ensure AI does not rely on vulnerable or outdated OSS components?</li>
  <li>What mechanisms best validate AI-safe dependency policies?</li>
  <li>How do we balance cost against systemic OSS risks effectively?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="if-youre-solving-something-similar">If You’re Solving Something Similar…</h2>

<p>We invite collaboration and shared insights on ensuring AI-integrated systems are free from outdated or vulnerable OSS components, enhancing the way dependencies and supply chain risks are managed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe we can reframe software delivery from the ground up, where every decision, tool, and interaction is guided by contextual intelligence.</p>
